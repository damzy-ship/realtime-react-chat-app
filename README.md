## About
I developed `Dee-chat` due to my curiosity and interest in backend and realtime data management. I initially attempted creating the backend and database with `Node js`, `Express js` and `Mongodb` but my curiosity took the better part and i found myself researching on how to manage the database and backend with firebase. After going through a few tutorials, i decided to replace the previous backend and achieve the same task using firebase in a more quicker and easier way. I used `firebase auth` for user authentication and `firebase firestore` for real time data management
